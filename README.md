# Monkeyboard Android Radio App

This project is for getting the monkeyboard radio app to work properly on the android operating system.

Some (Mostly the USB interface stuff) of the source code was given to me by the original creator of the app which can be found on the app store.

I have so far updated the app to run the radio connection as a service and behave properly with android audio.

This project is written in B4A as that is what was supplied from the beginning,

I have tried to comment some of the confusing parts of the source code which can mostly be found in RadioSerivce.bas

FM functionality has been Depricated, I do not have an FM arial connected to my board and as such have no way of using it.

Any contributions bug fixes welcome.
